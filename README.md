# fetchinsta
A Python Script to download every publicly available posts from a username and save it locally on your device.
This script prompts you to input the username of the Instagram account you want to download posts from, the location where you want to save the files, and whether you want to download videos or not. Then, it downloads all posts from that account and saves them into the specified directory. If the post is a carousel, it creates a separate folder for it within the main directory.
